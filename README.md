# ActiMut-XGB
This repository presents an XGBoost-based model for predicting protein thermostability using sequence-based features. Integrating ESM2 embeddings, physicochemical, evolutionary, and positional features, the model is enhanced by transfer learning and validated on CALB mutants, offering insights for protein engineering.
